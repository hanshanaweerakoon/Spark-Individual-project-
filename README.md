                              HAND GESTURES CONTROL VIRTUAL MOUSE

This project enables users to control a computer cursor using hand gestures. Utilizing a webcam, OpenCV, MediaPipe and pyautogui, it provides a contactless and interactive way to navigate a computer. The system tracks hand movements, maps them to screen coordinates, and detects gestures for left-click, right-click, and scrolling. It consists of a Raspberry Pi 4B, a USB webcam(Here I used my mobile phone camera) and software tools such as Raspberry Pi OS, OpenCV, MediaPipe and Python. The implementation involves installing required libraries, capturing video input, tracking hand landmarks, mapping hand movements, detecting gestures and simulating cursor control with pyautogui. The expected outcome is a smoothly moving cursor controlled by hand gestures with a pinch gesture for left-click and right-click and additional gesture for scrolling. This project is useful for touchless interaction and accessibility and can be further enhanced with AI-based gesture recognition. It demonstrates an innovative, contactless way to control a computer using hand gestures, leveraging Raspberry Pi and computer vision.
